### DIY - Tasks:

[ ] Create a quick Python Flask Application - Refer to this [documentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flask-creating-first-simple-application/)

[ ] SignUp/Login to your **Elastic Cloud** (use the free sign up option) and create a deployment with **Integration Server** - Refer to this [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-manage-integrations-server.html)

[ ] Attach the Flask APM code snippet to the application - Refer to this [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/python/current/flask-support.html)

[ ] Observe the API Transactions and Spans appearing in the Kibana UI under Observability > APM.

[ ] Increase the complexity of the application with additional routes and including a database to notice **Traces, Transactions, and Span** across services.
